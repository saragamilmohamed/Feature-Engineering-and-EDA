# 📱 Google Play Store Analysis – Feature Engineering & EDA

This repository presents an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** project on the **Google Play Store** dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about app ratings, reviews, pricing models, categories, and more — which can help developers and stakeholders understand what drives app success on the platform.

##  Key Insights Explored

* Distribution of app **ratings** and how they relate to **number of reviews**, **category**, and **installs**.
* **Free vs. Paid** apps comparison across categories.
* Common **content ratings** and their influence on user engagement.
* Cleaning and converting complex fields such as:

  * `'Size'`, `'Installs'`, and `'Price'` columns.
* Encoding categorical variables for further modeling use.
* Correlation analysis between app features and user feedback.
